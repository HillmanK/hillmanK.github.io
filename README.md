# THE|GEEK Small Business homepage

This page was created as part of the Codecademy's 'Company Home Page Challenge Project'-with a focus on using Flexbox. I created a homepage for a small artist/designer business focused on recreating designs of fictional characters-The business name is The|Geek.

This is a fictional homepage and credit for the artwork in the images displayed should be given to Magic Craftsy (etsy.com) (Images 1, 2, 4 and 5), James Patrick of JPSHOMESTORE (etsy.com) (Image 3) and KirLink (DeviantArt) (Banner).
